Web3 needs many different roles, not only programmers. Here is the roadmap we suggest for those interested in non-developer roles in web3:

Step 1: Understand blockchain concepts such as consensus models, hash functions, public/private keys, digital signing, and nodes/network. Don’t step too much time here, but still have a good understanding.

Step 2: Understand the web3 landscape by going into the rabbit hole into the concepts that interest you the most. 

Step 3: Become a user just to play around and have experience in real life. You can buy crypto, play around with wallets and NFT marketplaces.

Step 4: Join a DAO – find a DAO that interests you the most and start joining townhalls, be active on Discord, and take responsibility in the DAO by listing your skills.

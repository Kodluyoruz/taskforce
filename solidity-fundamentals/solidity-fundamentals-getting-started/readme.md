Welcome to this solidity tutorial. In this tutorial we are going to create a proposal contract together. 
In this contract:
- We will be able to create a new `proposal` and store them, creating a `proposal history`.
- Users will be able to `vote` for the proposal,
- Also, they will be able to see the `current state of the proposal` or any other proposals that is resulted.

Now, before jumping the contract creation, let's warm some coding muscles, shall we?

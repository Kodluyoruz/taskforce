To understand better what web3 is, we need to look  at  the history. What changed and what is about to change?  
 - Web1 - Oldest version of the web. Static, read-only content
 - Web2 - Current version of the web we use today. Interactive, read-write content
 - Web3 - Future version of the web. Verifiable, read-write-own/trust content

"Web3 refers to a potential new iteration of the internet that runs on public blockchains, the record-keeping technology best known for facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. The appeal of Web3 is that it is decentralized, so that instead of users accessing the internet through services mediated by the likes of Google, Apple, or Facebook, it’s the individuals themselves who own and control pieces of the internet. Web3 does not require “permission,” meaning that central authorities don’t dictate who uses what services, nor is there a need for “trust,” referring to the idea that an intermediary does not need to facilitate virtual transactions between two or more parties. Web3 theoretically protects user privacy better as well, because it’s these authorities and intermediaries that are doing most of the data collection." - [Slate](https://slate.com/technology/2021/11/web3-explained-crypto-nfts-bored-apes.html)

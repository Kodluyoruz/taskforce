# The course outline

This course will proceed as follows.



First you will see NEAR tools and how to use AssemblyScript in NEAR. Second, we will learn about NEAR specific concepts. Finally, we will review the projects developed with NEAR. Then we will expect you to develop your projects.

So please, for the rest of the course...

- DO NOT wait until you understand everything,  FOCUS on trying to make something simple
- DO NOT dive into consensus and economics, FOCUS on trying to study working examples
- DO NOT insist on learning to write Rust, FOCUS on using the best language for YOU
- DO NOT add complexity with frontend code, FOCUS on writing contract code

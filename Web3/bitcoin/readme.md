Bitcoin is the most known and most used digital currency. Without a middleman it can be transferred from user to user on a peer-to-peer network. There are network nodes to verify transactions and record them in a public distributed ledger which in other word blockchain.

Invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and began use in 2009.

Recommend you to read [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) to understand it better.

Did you know the first payment with Bitcoin was ordering two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin! 

"Bitcoin uses blockchain and therefore is decentralized, immutable, and open. It’s also:

1. Hard capped: There will only ever be 21M bitcoin. 
2. Single-purpose: Many holders just want it to be a digital token that stores value.


But most people don’t want Bitcoin to change. After all, if Bitcoin becomes the best way to store value and lets anyone send money around the world, that’s already a huge accomplishment."

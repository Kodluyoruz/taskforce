**Secure your account**

Choose your account recovery method. "Secure Passphrase" or Ledger is recommended as the most secure method.

**Secure Passphrase**

When selecting a Secure Passphrase / [seed phrase](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase) it is extremely important to write down your words IN ORDER and keep them in a safe place! NEAR Team will not be able to help you recover your account without it.

E-mail
When choosing e-mail, a ONE TIME recovery link will be sent to you that will have a recovery seed phrase embedded in the URL.

Here you can view your total balance, available balance, and minimum balance needed for on-chain storage costs. Also, you can view and rotate your [Access Keys](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/account#access-keys) by enabling (add) or disabling (delete) them.

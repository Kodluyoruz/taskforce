Ethereum is an open-source blockchain that allows use of smart contract service. This means Ethereum allows builders to create and deploy decentralized applications onto blockchain. So in this way users can interact with blockchain through DApps. Ethereum also provided new words to our lives such as DeFi, NFT and DAO.  

Ethereum is preparing for an upgrade called Ethereum 2.0 which comes with the new consensus method Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work and some improvements for transactions.

Recommend you to read [Ethereum Whitepaper]( https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) to understand it better.

"To understand what that even means, let’s define the following:

![ethereum definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kodluyoruz/taskforce/main/Web3/ethereum/figures/ethereum.png)

1. Ether is Ethereum’s digital token. Ether is a store of value like Bitcoin, but its main purpose is to reward nodes on the ethereum blockchain for processing transactions.
2. Gas is the amount of Ether that’s paid to a node to process a transaction. 
3. Smart contracts are code that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This code is:
    1. Decentralized: Stored across all nodes in the network.
    2. Immutable: Can’t be changed once committed to the blockchain.
    3. Open: Anyone can view the code and use it (like an open API).
4. Decentralized apps (dapp) combine a backend smart contract with frontend UI.

Dapps are where the action is in crypto and the majority are built on Ethereum. Examples include:

1. [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) for buying and selling digital assets.
2. [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?utm_source=StateOfTheDApps) for swapping digital tokens.
3. [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) for owning land in a 3D digital world.v

All of these dapps cost gas to run. That’s why Ethereum is upgrading to ['eth 2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/)' (which includes shifting from proof of work to stake) to scale the network, reduce energy consumption, and lower gas fees."

## Functions

Functions are declared using the function keyword. Functions have two types: 

- **View**: Functions that modify the state in some way. This includes emitting events, writing to state variables, and sending Ether. 
- **Pure**: Functions that only use the local variables. They cannot perform such actions as reading state variables or accessing a balance of a wallet address.

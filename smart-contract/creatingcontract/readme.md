One of the best ways to understand any programming language is to break it down by each element. In this lesson, we will look at the fundamentals of Solidity by looking at some of the elements of the code of a smart contract. 

## Pragma 
At the start of every smart contract, you will see the pragma version declared. This is important because it tells the Solidity compiler what version to use. This is to prevent any breaking changes when future versions of the compiler are released. If you are working with someone else's code, it is also important to note that you are using the same compiler version. 

## Creating a Contract
To create a contract in Solidity, the contract keyword is used followed by the name of the smart contract you would like to use. After declaring a contract, you can also create a **constructor** that is executed once the contract is created. 

## Declaring Variables
There are 3 types of variables that Solidity supports: 
- **State Variables**: Values are stored permanently in the storage of the contract
- **Local Variables**: Values are only stored while the function is executing 
- **Global Variables**: Values that get information about the blockchain and use a global naming. 

## Variable Types
Below you will find a video of the different variable types in Solidity and how they are declared.

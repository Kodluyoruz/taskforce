## Events

Events allow for logging of any happenings in your smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain. These events can be listened to and can be used to update a user interface or trigger some external functionality. They can also be used to return the value of a certain transaction which can be useful for a smart contract that reads those values to perform an operation.   

More information about the events and how they can be used by a dApp can be found in the video above.

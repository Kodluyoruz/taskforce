## Etherscan 

Another important part of deploying your smart contract is monitoring its activity. [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a blockchain explorer that allows you to view addresses, activities, and blocks of the Ethereum network. There are also explorer options available for testnets. 

When using Remix and other tools for deployment, you will be provided a link to Etherscan that is to the address of your smart contract. It is good to get comfortable using Etherscan as a developer as it can give you some important information and insights about the Ethereum blockchain. Above is a good tutorial explaining the different elements of the Etherscan.  

Congratulations, you now have learned the fundamentals of Solidity, created a secure and functional smart contract, and deployed it to a testnet using a node provider! The journey doesn't end here, in our next and final lesson will explore some potential next steps for you on your journey.

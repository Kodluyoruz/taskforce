## Node Providers 

To deploy to either a testnet or mainnet, you will need to use a Node provider. These services provide access to an Ethereum node, the physical hardware running the Ethereum network,  that will be responsible for committing your smart contract to the blockchain. Using an external service is valuable because setting up your own node can take a long time (weeks), need to be regularly upgraded, struggle to scale, and is costly. 

There are many popular node providers available for developers including [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://infura.io), [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/), [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/) and [Moralis](https://moralis.io/). 

Each of these node service providers offers some unique features. We will use Alchemy for the sake of this course since they offer one of the best free tiers. The video above will show you how to deploy a smart contract using Remix and Alchemy.

We have now created a smart contract that we feel is secure and well tested, it's time to deploy it to the blockchain so users can interact with it. When talking about deploying a smart contract, there are two options:

**Testnet:**  Testnets are test networks that you can deploy your smart contracts to for testing. These offer a low-cost/risk environment for working with a smart contract. The tokens and transactions on a testnet are not connected to those on mainnet. 

The main benefit of using a testnet is that they operate in a similar way to the mainnet so you can have a better understanding of how your contract will function before deploying it there. 

**Mainnet:** Mainnet is the live network of the Ethereum blockchain. You want to make sure that your contact has been tested and audited before deploying it here. Your contract will now be fully accessible to any address and they can start to transact with it. There are gas fees that you will need to pay to deploy and transact with your smart contract.

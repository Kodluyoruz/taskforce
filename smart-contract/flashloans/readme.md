## Flash Loans
Flash loans are a concept from decentralized finance (DeFi) that allow users to receive loans without the requirement of providing collateral.  A user can borrow funds from a liquidity pool, which are pools of tokens contributed by other users, and use those tokens to make a profit before returning them to the pool. 

This is possible because of two concepts: 

**Blockchain Transaction Time** - Since there is time between a transaction being made before it is added to the blockchain, there is also time for other transactions to occur that might be related to the first transaction. Flash loans can perform the borrowing, selling, and paying back of the loan all in one block. 

**Smart Contract Computation** - Smart contracts can computationally add funds and perform transactions once their functions have been called. This allows for someone to borrow funds, perform some operations and then return the funds to the original owner or pool. Smart contracts can ensure that there is a profit being made by the borrower so that they are not receiving a loan that they can't pay back. 

Flash loan smart contacts use protocols like Aave to get funds from their liquidity pools. This video will show you how to create a flash loan smart contract and connect it to Aave:

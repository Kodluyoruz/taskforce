Now that you have learned and created your first smart contracts, the next step is to understand the power and use-cases of smart contracts in the real world. We will look at a few use cases here that you can work with to further develop your knowledge of smart contract development. 
## Multi-signature wallet
In most transactions, you have 1 sender and 1 receiver. The sender is responsible for signing the transaction using their public key which is a way of approving the transaction. In another situation, a user might want to transfer shared funds to a contract or wallet address.  This is common with DAOs that have a shared treasury that members contribute to and then vote on what to do with those funds. 

To address this need, a multi-signature wallet (Multisig) can be created. Multisig wallets require multiple users/addresses to sign off on an action before it is committed to the blockchain. This is powered by using a smart contract that expects multiple signatures before executing an operation. 

This video will show you how to create a Multisig wallet in Solidity:

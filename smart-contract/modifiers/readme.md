## Modifiers

When reading the code of a smart contract, you will see multiple types of modifiers. Thes modifiers help control the visibility and usability of the connected function or variable: 

**External** - Functions that will be called by outside contracts. These functions can not be called internally.

**Internal** - Functions that are only accessed only within the contract in which it is declared or any connected contracts. 

**Public**  - Functions and variables that can be called both internally and externally by outside contracts. 

**Private** - Functions and variables that can only be called in the contract in which it is declared. These functions can not be called by connected contracts either. 

Now that we have covered some of the fundamentals of a smart contract, let's look at how we can develop safe and secure smart contracts in the next lesson!

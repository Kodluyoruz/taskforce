Basic Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language or system background is essential for this course (It can be C#, C++, Eiffel, Java, Object Pascal, Objective-C, PHP, Python, REALbasic, Ruby, Simula, Smalltalk ve Visual Basic, . NET)

The rest of this course was prepared assuming that you have basic coding and OOP knowledge. If youâ€™re feeling comfortable with these prerequisites, we will cover the followings in this course:
- **Rust** (a programming language for building smart contracts on Solana): In Solana, we will develop programs using the Rust language. So, as a first step, we will learn to program with Rust.
- **Solana CLI:** It is a command line interface for Solana, also known as the CLI. Using Solana CLI and Solana Tool Suite we will build and deploy programs on Solana.
- **Deployment of our smart contracts on Testnets and Mainnet:** We will learn how to use wallets and faucets on browser and Solana CLI and how we can deploy our smart contracts.
- **Testing smart contracts using Anchor:** Anchor is a framework for Solana's Sealevel runtime providing several convenient developer tools. We will learn using Anchor framework for testing smart contracts.
- **Front-end integration with the Smart Contract:** Using Solana web3.js we will integrate smart contracts to frontend (optional).

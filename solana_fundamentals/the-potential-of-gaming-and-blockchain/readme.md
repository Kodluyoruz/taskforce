Billions of dollars have entered into the world of NFTs in the last 12 months. The game industry was one of the largest recipients of this investment. Big game companies like Sega, Konami, Zynga, Ubisoft, Epic Games have started to announce that they are entering the NFT field.

It’s believed that NFTs will be valuable to players in gaming since it creates true ownership of digital assets like skin attachments, resources, items and any other creations in a game. It means an owner can buy&sell items and build their game economy.

Recently, we have started to see the concepts of ‘play to earn’ and ‘move to earn’ more and more:
- Play to earn games are games that allow players to earn NFT rewards by completing missions, fighting other players, and progressing through game levels.
- Move to earn is similar to play to earn - it allows players to earn NFT rewards by completing missions. However, move to earn games connect your smartphones and tracks your movements to evaluate your progress.

It wouldn’t be wrong to expect more projects in this field in the coming days, especially with the push from the metaverse trend as well.

Solana itself organized some events to explain these topics. Here are the links to some of these events:
